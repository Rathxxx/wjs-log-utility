# Transaction Log Parser for WJS

This utility was written for my buddy WJS to assist him with parsing and deduping records within his log files from work. It follows a very specific use case.


## Usage

From command line pass the path to where the log files are located. The utility will output UniqueTransactions.trn and NonUniqueTransactions.trn files.
